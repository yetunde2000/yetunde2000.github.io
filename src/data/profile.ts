  about: `I am a  post-master’s researcher  at [DGIST IBOM](https://ibom.dgist.ac.kr/, color=blue), advised by Prof. Cheol Songin the Department of Robotics and Mechatronics Engineering. 
My research focuses on enhancing VR tracking accuracy through sensor fusion and learning-based signal processing, 
utilizing models such as the Transformer and Time2Vec. I am particularly interested in measurement-driven approaches that improve the robustness and precision of immersive systems for fine-scale manipulation tasks.
